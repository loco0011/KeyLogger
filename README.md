## ERROR
"Connection unexpectedly closed"

1. Enable "Less secure apps" access (Not Recommended):
Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
Click on "Security" in the left menu.
Under "Signing in to Google," click on "Less secure app access."
Turn on "Allow less secure apps." Please note that this option is less secure and not recommended by Google. Use it only for testing purposes or if you have difficulty with app passwords.

2. Use an App Password (Recommended):
Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
Click on "Security" in the left menu.
Under "Signing in to Google," click on "App passwords."
If prompted, sign in to your Google account.
Click on "Select app" and choose "Mail."
Click on "Select device" and choose "Other (Custom name)."
Enter a custom name for your keylogger (e.g., "MyKeylogger").
Click on "Generate" to get the app password.
Copy the generated app password.
Replace FROM_EMAIL_PASSWORD in your keylogger code with the generated app password.
After making the changes, run your keylogger again and see if it can send emails without the "Connection unexpectedly closed" error.

However, if you've made some money using my tools or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, please consider giving back on
